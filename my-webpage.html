            <h1>Sychelles</h1>
            <div class="p">
                <p>Seychelles is a paradise on Earth. The beautiful country is blessed with deep blue waters and white
                    sandy beaches with exotic sea life, becoming a famous honeymoon destination. The 115-island country
                    is within the Indian Ocean off East Africa and actually has the least population among independent
                    African countries.
                    Some of the rarest species of birds can be found in Seychelles, including the bare-legged Scops Owl
                    or Syer. This specific owl is so rare it was once thought to have become extinct, but was
                    rediscovered in 1959. You can find it at the Morne Seychellois National Park on Mahé Island.
                    The native Coco de mer, also known as the sea coconut or double coconut, produces the heaviest
                    (about 15kg) and largest seed in the world.
                    Ian Fleming, the author of the famous James Bond novels and short stories, came to the Seychelles
                    islands in 1958 to find inspiration for the next chapter in the spy saga (For Your Eyes Only) and
                    ended up naming one of his characters, Milton Krest, after a tonic and ginger beverage that he
                    tasted during his stay.

                    In modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative body of government.
                    Generally, a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government via hearings and inquiries. 
                    he term is similar to the idea of a senate, synod or congress, and is commonly used in countries that are current or former monarchies, a form of government with a monarch as the head.
